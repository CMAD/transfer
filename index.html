        <h1>What is this about?</h1>

<p>This project is a simple incremental backup script that uses
rsync to transfer files.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how you might call it once:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<pre>transfer -r example.net -s apache <span class="s">&lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span class="s">/var/www/</span>
<span class="s">/srv/www/</span>
<span class="s">/etc/apache2/</span>
<span class="s">EOF</span>
</pre>
</div>


<p>And what it may give you in return:</p>

<pre><code>/var/backups/hosts.d/ # the base directory to store backups into
└── example.net       # remote
     └── apache       # subject
         ├── empty    
         ├── err      # failed copies
         ├── ok       # copies that finished correctly
         │   ├── 20120405195300  # date/time
         │   │   ├── data.d      # actuall files
         │   │   ├── start       # start date/time
         │   │   ├── end         # finish date/time
         │   │   ├── subject     # a name like apache or files
         │   │   ├── remote      # remote server hostname
         │   │   ├── local       # backup server hostname
         │   │   ├── rsync.log   # transfer details
         │   │   ├── size        # size of files inside data.d
         │   │   ├── status      # status of this copy (ok or err)
         │   │   ├── uuid        # id
         │   │   ├── previous    # parent id
         │   │   └── version     # version of the script
         │   └── last -&gt; /var/backups/.../ok/20120405195300
         └── tmp      # meanwhile a copy is made
</code></pre>

<h1>Why should I use it?</h1>

<p>Do you need to retain and query information about how a
backup was made but will prefer to not use a database?</p>

<p>Maybe you will reallocate copies to other servers but wish
you could known where did it come from?</p>

<p>Do not know where to place the files you want to restore
again?</p>

<p>Want to save space but wish you don't need to wait for
hours for a reconstruction process when you need some
old files?</p>

<p>Must you store things in the filesystem directly for performance,
storage restrictions or easy of access?</p>

<p>Absolutely need data stored in backups to be directly explorable
and manipulable because you don't know where that file may be?</p>

<p>You wish to construct you own backup policy, create you own reports
or make tools around the process?</p>

<p>Hate push backups because you don't want your backups to get
deleted by intruders?</p>

<p>transfer is pretty dumb, but can help with a lot of complicated
problems, and it's just around 200 lines of shellscript (maybe half
of that are comments!).</p>

<p>Please try, and come to love or hate it.</p>

<h1>How this came to be?</h1>

<p>Once upon a time there was a tool created by the local
wizard, him who created the current infrastructure.</p>

<p>And for a time, things worked well, and people were
happy.</p>

<p>But eventually, he went to explore new lands, leaving
his precious infrastructure for others to guard.</p>

<p>And then, there came a problem, nobody understood
his work, and things no longer worked well.</p>

<p>With no adequate replacements, dark times ensured.</p>

<p>Aberrations started to dwell in the new servers. And
sometimes managed to get in the old ones too.</p>

<p>Time passed and things got worse, till a ray of hope
shined in the middle of darkness.</p>

<p>A new tool appeared, it was young, but everybody could
understand it.</p>

<p>Should we trust that tool?</p>

<h1>How do I get it?</h1>

<p>At the top of the page there are download links, I will recommend
to get into the github page.</p>

<p>Check the README and source code. Run it once. Think about it.</p>

<h1>Can I ask a question, contribute a patch or say hi?</h1>

<p>Sure, send me an email (check my github profile) or ping me
at twitter (@CarlosAntelo), you can also make a pull request
if you want to.</p>

<p>I will be very happy so just do it.</p>
