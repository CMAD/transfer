{"name":"transfer","body":"# What is this about?\r\n\r\nThis project is a simple incremental backup script that uses\r\nrsync to transfer files.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of how you might call it once:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ntransfer -r example.net -s apache <<EOF\r\n/var/www/\r\n/srv/www/\r\n/etc/apache2/\r\nEOF\r\n```\r\nAnd what it may give you in return:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/var/backups/hosts.d/ # the base directory to store backups into\r\n└── example.net       # remote\r\n     └── apache       # subject\r\n         ├── empty    \r\n         ├── err      # failed copies\r\n         ├── ok       # copies that finished correctly\r\n         │   ├── 20120405195300  # date/time\r\n         │   │   ├── data.d      # actuall files\r\n         │   │   ├── start       # start date/time\r\n         │   │   ├── end         # finish date/time\r\n         │   │   ├── subject     # a name like apache or files\r\n         │   │   ├── remote      # remote server hostname\r\n         │   │   ├── local       # backup server hostname\r\n         │   │   ├── rsync.log   # transfer details\r\n         │   │   ├── size        # size of files inside data.d\r\n         │   │   ├── status      # status of this copy (ok or err)\r\n         │   │   ├── uuid        # id\r\n         │   │   ├── previous    # parent id\r\n         │   │   └── version     # version of the script\r\n         │   └── last -> /var/backups/.../ok/20120405195300\r\n         └── tmp      # meanwhile a copy is made\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Why should I use it?\r\n\r\nDo you need to retain and query information about how a\r\nbackup was made but will prefer to not use a database?\r\n \r\nMaybe you will reallocate copies to other servers but wish\r\nyou could known where did it come from?\r\n \r\nDo not know where to place the files you want to restore\r\nagain?\r\n \r\nWant to save space but wish you don't need to wait for\r\nhours for a reconstruction process when you need some\r\nold files?\r\n \r\nMust you store things in the filesystem directly for performance,\r\nstorage restrictions or easy of access?\r\n \r\nAbsolutely need data stored in backups to be directly explorable\r\nand manipulable because you don't know where that file may be?\r\n \r\nYou wish to construct you own backup policy, create you own reports\r\nor make tools around the process?\r\n \r\nHate push backups because you don't want your backups to get\r\ndeleted by intruders?\r\n \r\ntransfer is pretty dumb, but can help with a lot of complicated\r\nproblems, and it's just around 200 lines of shellscript (maybe half\r\nof that are comments!).\r\n \r\nPlease try, and come to love or hate it.\r\n\r\n# How this came to be?\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a tool created by the local\r\nwizard, him who created the current infrastructure.\r\n \r\nAnd for a time, things worked well, and people were\r\nhappy.\r\n \r\nBut eventually, he went to explore new lands, leaving\r\nhis precious infrastructure for others to guard.\r\n \r\nAnd then, there came a problem, nobody understood\r\nhis work, and things no longer worked well.\r\n \r\nWith no adequate replacements, dark times ensured.\r\n \r\nAberrations started to dwell in the new servers. And\r\nsometimes managed to get in the old ones too.\r\n \r\nTime passed and things got worse, till a ray of hope\r\nshined in the middle of darkness.\r\n \r\nA new tool appeared, it was young, but everybody could\r\nunderstand it.\r\n \r\nShould we trust that tool?\r\n\r\n# How do I get it?\r\n\r\nAt the top of the page there are download links, I will recommend\r\nto get into the github page.\r\n\r\nCheck the README and source code. Run it once. Think about it.\r\n\r\n# Can I ask a question, contribute a patch or say hi?\r\n\r\nSure, send me an email (check my github profile) or ping me\r\nat twitter (@CarlosAntelo), you can also make a pull request\r\nif you want to.\r\n\r\nI will be very happy so just do it.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Simple, but powerful rsync based backup mechanism.","google":"UA-30648788-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
